## LAB 4 - INTRODUCTION TO DATA MOVEMENT

### EXAMPLES

[**Example 4.1**](https://github.com/leander-dsouza/MSP432P401R/blob/master/Keil/LAB%204/Example4.1.s)

* To analyze the barrel shifter and movement of data within the architecture.

[**Example 4.2**](https://github.com/leander-dsouza/MSP432P401R/blob/master/Keil/LAB%204/Example4.2.s)

* To analyze the data movement for pre indexing and post indexing of data.

### EXERCISES

*Note: All the values are given in decimal value convert them to hexadecimal while performing the experiment.*

[**Exercise 4.1**](https://github.com/leander-dsouza/MSP432P401R/blob/master/Keil/LAB%204/Exercise4.1.s)

* Write an assembly language programming for moving the sensor value 20 to register bank with a pre indexing value 12 rotated left by 2 and load into an another register which is interfaced with a DC motor for rotation.

[**Exercise 4.2**](https://github.com/leander-dsouza/MSP432P401R/blob/master/Keil/LAB%204/Exercise4.2.s)

* Write an assembly language to store a value 11 in any assumed register to be pre-indexed by #2 and right rotated by the multiplicand of 2.
