## LAB 5 - ADDRESSING MODES OF MSP432P401R

### EXAMPLES

[**Example 5.1**](https://github.com/leander-dsouza/MSP432P401R/blob/master/Keil/LAB%205/Example5.1.s)

* Write an assembly language programming to send the data value from register to memory location and load it back from different address of any specified memory.

[**Example 5.2**](https://github.com/leander-dsouza/MSP432P401R/blob/master/Keil/LAB%205/Example5.2.s)

* Write an assembly language programming to send the data value from register to memory location and load it back from different address of any specified memory after performing arithmetic operation in a loop.

### EXERCISES

[**Exercise 5.1**](https://github.com/leander-dsouza/MSP432P401R/blob/master/Keil/LAB%205/Exercise5.1.s)

* Write an assembly program to store data of a memory location 255 to 260 in register R0 onwards.

[**Exercise 5.2**](https://github.com/leander-dsouza/MSP432P401R/blob/master/Keil/LAB%205/Exercise5.2.s)

* Write an assembly program to store all the even numbers in register R6 and all the odd numbers in register R7. The process should be executed in a loop.
