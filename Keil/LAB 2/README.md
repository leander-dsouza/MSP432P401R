## LAB 2 - INTRODUCTION TO ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS USING MSP432P401R

### EXAMPLES

[**Example 2.1**](https://github.com/leander-dsouza/MSP432P401R/blob/master/Keil/LAB%202/Example2.1.s)

* WAP to analyze the arithmetic operation using ADD and ADC.

[**Example 2.2**](https://github.com/leander-dsouza/MSP432P401R/blob/master/Keil/LAB%202/Example2.2.s)

* WAP to analyze the arithmetic operation using SUB and SBC.

[**Example 2.3**](https://github.com/leander-dsouza/MSP432P401R/blob/master/Keil/LAB%202/Example2.3.s)

* WAP to analyze the arithmetic operation using RSB.

### EXERCISES
*Note: All the values are given in decimal value convert them to hexadecimal while performing the experiment.*

[**Exercise 2.1**](https://github.com/leander-dsouza/MSP432P401R/blob/master/Keil/LAB%202/Exercise2.1.s)

* Write an assembly language to ADD 16 & 19 and the output to perform ADC with 6. Analyze the register behavior.

[**Exercise 2.2**](https://github.com/leander-dsouza/MSP432P401R/blob/master/Keil/LAB%202/Exercise2.2.s)

* Write an assembly language to perform following operation R0= 24-16 with a carry 3.

[**Exercise 2.3**](https://github.com/leander-dsouza/MSP432P401R/blob/master/Keil/LAB%202/Exercise2.3.s)

* Write an assembly language to perform the following example:
	Ramesh has a habit of reverse subtraction, one day he went to retailer store to buy a packet of milk for rupees 18/- and chocolate for rupees 20/-. He gave rupees 100/- to the shopkeeper and asked for rupees 3536/-. Check in debugging whether Ramesh calculations were correct or wrong.
