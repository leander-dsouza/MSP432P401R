## LAB 1 - INTRODUCTION TO MSP432P401R SIMULATION SOFTWARE

### EXAMPLES

[**Example 1.1**](https://github.com/leander-dsouza/MSP432P401R/blob/master/Keil/LAB%201/Example1.1.s) : 

* To Familiarize with Keil and MSP432P401R.

[**Example 1.2**](https://github.com/leander-dsouza/MSP432P401R/blob/master/Keil/LAB%201/Example1.2.s) : 

* Write an assembly language program to perform addition between 25 and 35, and store the output in R3 register of MSP432P401R. Show the output in Debugging window.
Syntax: ADD  Operand 1 + Operand 2

[**Example 1.3**](https://github.com/leander-dsouza/MSP432P401R/blob/master/Keil/LAB%201/Example1.3.s) :

* Write an assembly language program to perform subtraction between 25 and 35, and store the output in R3 register of MSP432P401R. Show the output in Debugging window.
Syntax: SUB Operand 1 - Operand 2

### EXERCISES

[**Exercise 1.1**](https://github.com/leander-dsouza/MSP432P401R/blob/master/Keil/LAB%201/Exercise1.1.s) :

* Write an assembly language to ADD 16, 19, 22, 47 and store the value in different register.

[**Exercise 1.2**](https://github.com/leander-dsouza/MSP432P401R/blob/master/Keil/LAB%201/Exercise1.2.s) :

* Write an assembly language to perform following operation (10-9-3-1) and store the output value in different register.

[**Exercise 1.3**](https://github.com/leander-dsouza/MSP432P401R/blob/master/Keil/LAB%201/Exercise1.3.s) :

* Write an assembly language to perform following operation R0 = 9 + (34 – 4 – 2).
