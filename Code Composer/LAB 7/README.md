## LAB 7 - USE OF DELAY IN MSP432P401R

### EXAMPLES

[**Example 7.1**](https://github.com/leander-dsouza/MSP432P401R/blob/master/Code%20Composer/LAB%207/Example7.1.c)

* Write an Embedded C programming language to generate a delay of one second using FOR loop condition.

[**Example 7.2**](https://github.com/leander-dsouza/MSP432P401R/blob/master/Code%20Composer/LAB%207/Example7.2.c)

* Write an Embedded C programming language to generate a delay of one second using XTML as 48MHz (crystal frequency).

### EXERCISES

[**Exercise 7.1**](https://github.com/leander-dsouza/MSP432P401R/blob/master/Code%20Composer/LAB%207/Exercise7.1.c)

* Write an Embedded C programming language for generating a delay of 4 seconds using a 3MHz crystal frequency and toggle RED LED at P1.0.

[**Exercise 7.2**](https://github.com/leander-dsouza/MSP432P401R/blob/master/Code%20Composer/LAB%207/Exercise7.2.c)

* Write an Embedded C programming language for switching RED LED, GREEN LED, BLUE LED each individually ON after 2 seconds of delay simultaneously use 12MHz clock for scaling.

[**Exercise 7.3**](https://github.com/leander-dsouza/MSP432P401R/blob/master/Code%20Composer/LAB%207/Exercise7.3.c)

* Write an Embedded C programming language to 2 LED’s with different clocks 12MHz and 48MHz simultaneously. *Condition: Both the LED’s should be scaled to 1sec delay of toggle.*
