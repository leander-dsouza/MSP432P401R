## LAB 8 - READING I/O PORTS IN MSP432P401R

### EXAMPLES

[**Example 8.1**](https://github.com/leander-dsouza/MSP432P401R/blob/master/Code%20Composer/LAB%208/Example8.1.c)

* Write an Embedded C programming language to read data from P1.1 and write a toggling value to RGB green LED.

[**Example 8.2**](https://github.com/leander-dsouza/MSP432P401R/blob/master/Code%20Composer/LAB%208/Example8.2.c)

* Write an Embedded C programming language to read data from P1.1 and write a toggling value to RGB green LED with a delay of 1 second using a clock frequency of 48MHz.

### EXERCISES

[**Exercise 8.1**](https://github.com/leander-dsouza/MSP432P401R/blob/master/Code%20Composer/LAB%208/Exercise8.1.c)

* Write an Embedded C programming for toggling RGB LED simultaneously after pressing P1.4 with a delay of 1 second using predefined clock 48MHz.

[**Exercise 8.2**](https://github.com/leander-dsouza/MSP432P401R/blob/master/Code%20Composer/LAB%208/Exercise8.2.c)

* Write an Embedded C programming for interfacing P1.1 and P1.4 switches, with a condition of AND gate interfaced with RED status LED at P1.0.
