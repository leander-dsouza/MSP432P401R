[**Example 6.2**](https://github.com/leander-dsouza/MSP432P401R/blob/master/Code%20Composer/LAB%206/Example6.2.c)

* Write a C programming language to toggle RGB LED’s at pin P2.0, P2.1, P2.2.

### EXERCISES

[**Exercise 6.1**](https://github.com/leander-dsouza/MSP432P401R/blob/master/Code%20Composer/LAB%206/Exercise6.1.c)

* Write an assembly language program to toggle RGB LED’s individually. Set a visible frequency. 

[**Exercise 6.2**](https://github.com/leander-dsouza/MSP432P401R/blob/master/Code%20Composer/LAB%206/Exercise6.2.c)
