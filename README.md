# MBSD LAB CODES
All the codes present in this repository have been verified and demonstrated on the MSP432P401R Launchpad. These Lab Codes belonged to my MBSD (Microcontroller Based System Design) course in my pursue of a BTech in Mechatronics. 

A Lab Manual has been attached to address the Lab questions and outcomes. A sufficient README has also been attached to each of the Lab Folders.
